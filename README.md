#Model Rocket Simulation

A simple flight simulation of a 100g, c-class model rocket 
that outputs altitude vs time. This simulation is meant to 
assist in the development of model rockets for the McMaster 
Rocketry Team. Taken into account were the rocket mass, engine
mass, and drag force. The simulation is developed based on this
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEf1Ghb5s4U).


The rocket engine used is an Estes c6-5. The thrust data used 
is provided by Estes [here](https://www.nar.org/SandT/pdf/Estes/C6.pdf).
